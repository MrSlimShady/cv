I have tried approaching MNIST digits data set in 3 different ways here.<br>
<ol>
<li>Neural Network</li>
<li>cnn</li>
<li>rnn(lstm)</li>
<ol>
<br>
For reproducing the results clone the repo and make a folder called 'digits' and insert all the data set files downloaded from http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/
into the folder. Also make a folder 'mnistd' and download the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/c/digit-recognizer/data and put it into this folder.
